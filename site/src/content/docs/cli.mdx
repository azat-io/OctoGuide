OctoGuide also provides a standalone `octoguide` CLI you can run outside GitHub Actions.
`octoguide` can analyze a GitHub contribution and preview what rule violations that the OctoGuide action would report for it.

<PackageManagers
	args="https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/19"
	pkg="octoguide"
	type="dlx"
/>

```plaintext
Found 0 reports. Great! âœ…
```

:::note
The `octoguide` CLI only logs pretty-printed reports back in your terminal.
It does not create comments or otherwise post any data to GitHub.
:::

The `octoguide` CLI takes in one required positional argument for the activity to be scanned.
