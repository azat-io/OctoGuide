title: Building Rules
---

:::caution[Work in Progress]
OctoGuide doesn't support custom (user-defined) rules yet: [ðŸš€ Feature: Custom rules #22](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/issues/22).
If this feature is important to you, please do send a pull request! ðŸ˜‰
:::

OctoGuide rules each define how to analyze entities for a single best practice.
Each rule is defined as an object containing:

- `about`: [`RuleAbout`](./types#ruleabout): Metadata about the rule.
- Any number of _listener_ properties defining how the rule interacts with GitHub entities:
  - [`comment`](#comment)
  - [`issue`](#issue)
  - [`discussion`](#discussion)
  - [`pullRequest`](#pullrequest)

Rules are generally titled in the format of `<entity>-<area>(-<concern>)`:

- `<entity>`: one of `comment`, `discussion`, `issue`, `pr`, or the catch-all `text`
- `<area>`: the part of the entity, such as an issue's `required-fields` or a PR's `linked-issue`
- `<concern>`: if the rule checks a part of the area, such as an issue's required fields `content`

:::tip
OctoGuide rules are structurally similar to rules in linters such as ESLint.
You can even think of OctoGuide as a linter for GitHub activity.
These docs don't refer to OctoGuide as a linter because some users have a negative association with them.

## Defining Rules

Rules are created internally by OctoGuide using a `defineRule` function.

```ts title="src/rules/text-require-emoji.ts"
import { defineRule } from "./defineRule.js";

export const textRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	// ...
});
```

### `about`

Metadata about the rule.
This will be included in any [rule reports](./types#rulereport).

At least the properties in [`RuleAbout`](./types#ruleabout) are required.

```ts
export const issueRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	about: {
		description:
			"Issues should include an emoji to confirm our contributing guidelines.",
		explanation: [
			"Our CONTRIBUTING.md asks that you include an emoji in your issue.",
			"Not including an emoji hints that you haven't fully read the file. ðŸ˜œ",
		],
		name: "issue-require-emoji",
	},
	// ...
});
```

### Listener Properties

These rule properties are called if the corresponding entity type is what the rule is being run on.
A rule may define multiple of these if it is able to analyze multiple types of entities.

These properties may be asynchronous.
They each define two parameters:

- `context`: [`RuleContext`](./types#rulecontext)
- `entity`: [`Entity`](./types#entity)

#### `comment`

Runs if an entity is a comment on a discussion, issue, or pull request.

```ts
export const commentRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	// ...
	comment(context, entity) {
		if (entity.data.body && !/\p{Emoji}/u.test(entity.data.body)) {
			context.report({
				primary:
					"An emoji is missing, but our contributing guidelines ask that you include one.",
				secondary: [
					"Our contributing guidelines asks to include an emoji to indicate you read them.",
					"We know it's a little silly, but we've found this check to be very helpful in getting contributors to read the docs.",
				],
				suggestion: [
					"To resolve this report, read the contributing docs, then include an emoji such as ðŸ©µ anywhere in your comment.",
				],
			});
		}
	},
});
```

#### `issue`

Runs if an entity is a issue.

```ts
export const issueRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	// ...
	issue(context, entity) {
		if (entity.data.body && !/\p{Emoji}/u.test(entity.data.body)) {
			context.report({
				primary:
					"An emoji is missing, but our contributing guidelines ask that you include one.",
				secondary: [
					"Our contributing guidelines asks to include an emoji to indicate you read them.",
					"We know it's a little silly, but we've found this check to be very helpful in getting contributors to read the docs.",
				],
				suggestion: [
					"To resolve this report, read the contributing docs, then include an emoji such as ðŸ©µ anywhere in your comment.",
				],
			});
		}
	},
});
```

#### `discussion`

Runs if an entity is a discussion.

```ts
export const discussionRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	// ...
	discussion(context, entity) {
		if (entity.data.body && !/\p{Emoji}/u.test(entity.data.body)) {
			context.report({
				primary:
					"An emoji is missing, but our contributing guidelines ask that you include one.",
				secondary: [
					"Our contributing guidelines asks to include an emoji to indicate you read them.",
					"We know it's a little silly, but we've found this check to be very helpful in getting contributors to read the docs.",
				],
				suggestion: [
					"To resolve this report, read the contributing docs, then include an emoji such as ðŸ©µ anywhere in your comment.",
				],
			});
		}
	},
});
```

#### `pullRequest`

Runs if an entity is a pull request.

```ts
export const pullRequestRequireEmoji = defineRule({
	// ...
	pullRequest(context, entity) {
		if (entity.data.body && !/\p{Emoji}/u.test(entity.data.body)) {
			context.report({
				primary:
					"An emoji is missing, but our contributing guidelines ask that you include one.",
				secondary: [
					"Our contributing guidelines asks to include an emoji to indicate you read them.",
					"We know it's a little silly, but we've found this check to be very helpful in getting contributors to read the docs.",
				],
				suggestion: [
					"To resolve this report, read the contributing docs, then include an emoji such as ðŸ©µ anywhere in your comment.",
				],
			});
		}
	},
});
```
