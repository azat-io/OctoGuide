title: Ecosystem Comparisons
---

OctoGuide is a lightweight action: it does not install dependencies or run any build scripts.
It runs as quickly as possible, generally around 10 seconds a run.

## Other Ecosystem Approaches

- [Danger](https://danger.systems): is a much larger, more powerful system that has repositories write their rules in imperative configuration files.
  However, Danger is not made for analyzing GitHub comments, discussions, or issues â€” only pull requests.
