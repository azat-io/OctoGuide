Posting replies containing just _"+1"_, _any update?"_, or other phrases without new information don't meaningfully contribute to a discussion.
If done too much, they can even become disruptive to other contributors.

The negative impacts of uninformative comments include:

- They send a notification to everybody subscribed to the issue or PR
- They take up space and crowd out more meaningful comments

## Alternatives to "+1"s and "-1"s

Enthusiasm for an issue is great, but posting just a _+1_ or _me too_ isn't an effective way to make your case.
If you have new information not yet posted then it's best to post that to support your opinion.
Otherwise, stick to [GitHub emoji reactions](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

## Alternatives to Asking for Updates

Most open source repositories perform all activity in public.
If there is any progress made, such as a PR being sent or updated, you'll see it publicly.
There's no need to explicitly ask for updates in repos that work in public this way.
