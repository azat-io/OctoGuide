<IncludedIn rule="comment-meaningless" />

Posting replies containing just _"+1"_, _any update?"_, or other phrases without new information don't meaningfully contribute to a discussion.
If done too much, they can even become disruptive to other contributors.

The negative impacts of uninformative comments include:

- They send a notification to everybody subscribed to the issue or PR
- They take up space and crowd out more meaningful comments

## Alternatives to "+1"s and "-1"s

Enthusiasm for an issue is great, but posting just a _+1_ or _me too_ isn't an effective way to make your case.
If you have new information not yet posted then it's best to post that to support your opinion.
Otherwise, stick to [GitHub emoji reactions](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

## Alternatives to Asking for Updates

Most open source repositories perform all activity in public.
If there is any progress made, such as a PR being sent or updated, you'll see it publicly.
There's no need to explicitly ask for updates in repos that work in public this way.

## Examples

[Comment that only states _"+1"_](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuideExamples/issues/2#issuecomment-2839206981):

<OctoGuideGitHubComment rule="comment-meaningless">
	Saying just <em>"+1"</em> doesn't add any new information to the discussion.
	Replies containing just <em>"+1"</em>, <em>"any update?"</em>, or other
	phrases without new information aren't helpful. They cause unnecessary
	notifications for other contributors and take up space. To resolve this
	report:
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you have new information that'll help the discussion, edit it into the
			comment
		</li>
		<li>Otherwise, delete the comment and emoji react to the issue</li>
	</ul>
</OctoGuideGitHubComment>
