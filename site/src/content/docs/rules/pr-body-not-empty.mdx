<IncludedIn rule="pr-body-not-empty" />

This repository expects pull requests to include a description explaining the changes.
The description should have at least one word not in the PR template, or any content if no template exists.

Pull requests should include meaningful descriptions that explain the purpose and context of the changes.
This helps reviewers understand what's being changed and why, making the review process more efficient.

## Requirements

- If no PR template exists, the pull request must have at least one word in its description
- If a PR template exists (in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`), the pull request must include at least one word that isn't part of the template

## Resolving Issues

To resolve violations of this rule:

- Add a meaningful description to your pull request
- Include details about what and why you changed
- If using a template, add your own words explaining the specific changes

## Examples

### Good

If a repository has a template with "## Description" and "Please describe your changes", a good PR description would be:

```markdown
## Description

I fixed the login issue by updating the authentication logic to handle expired tokens properly.
```

### Bad

Just using the template without adding any specific information:

```markdown
## Description

Please describe your changes
```
