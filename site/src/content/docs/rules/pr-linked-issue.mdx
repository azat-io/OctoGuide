A repository using this rule keeps to GitHub issues for discussing potential changes.
Most or all changes should be marked as approved in an issue before a pull request is sent to resolve them.

## Linking an Issue

To link a pull request to an issue:

1. Make sure there's an issue describing what you want to happen
2. Add text in the format `closes #...` or `fixes #...` in your PR, such as `fixes #123`

## Why Require Issues?

Requiring all contributor pull requests address an open issue adds process to a repository.
Not all repositories prefer this.
Some prefer to instead make it as straightforward as possible to send a pull request, and then only move conversations to issues as needed.

The advantages of starting with issues are:

- Consolidation: most or all conversations are moved to a single place, the issue tracker
- Discoverability: it's much easier to search within just the issue tracker, rather than also looking through ad hoc pull request discussions
- Tracking: issues often use different their own sets of labels tailored to their conversations

Most importantly, if you're contributing to a repository with a contribution guide, please read and respect that contribution guide.
